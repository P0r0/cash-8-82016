2.4 For the avoidance of doubt, Client acknowledges and agrees that any modification or attempted modification of the Software by any party other than GuardSquare will void GuardSquare's warranties with respect to the Licensed Products and will be deemed to represent a material breach of this Agreement by the Client.<br />

The Client agrees that neither the Software nor the Documentation, nor any product thereof, will be used except as expressly authorized by this Agreement and as permitted under applicable laws and regulations.

(i) is in the public domain at the time of disclosure or subsequently falls into the public domain through no breach of this Section 6 by the receiving Party, provided that the Client acknowledges and agrees that Confidential Information of GuardSquare shall not be deemed to be in the public domain merely because any part of said information is embodied in general disclosures or because individual features, components, or combinations thereof are now, or become, known to the public, through whatever means, including through means of the supply or commercialization of products or services based on or related to such Confidential Information;<br />
(ii) can be proven to the reasonable satisfaction of the disclosing Party to be lawfully in the receiving Party's possession prior to any disclosure by the disclosing Party and without an obligation of confidentiality towards the disclosing Party;<br />

<h4>7. Fees</h4>

7.1 As consideration for the license granted pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement and for the Support Services, the Client agrees to pay to GuardSquare the Fees, in accordance with the invoicing schedule set forth in Schedule 1 (or other written agreement between the Parties). Expenses (including travel (incl. local transport and flights), accommodation and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred by GuardSquare in furtherance of this Agreement shall be charged to the Client at GuardSquare's cost, in addition to the Fees. Where reasonably possible, such expenses shall be subject to the Client's prior consent (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld) and shall be evidenced by receipts.<br />
Undisputed invoices are due and payable by the Client within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. All payments made by the Client to GuardSquare under this Agreement shall be final and non refundable. The amount of any invoice which has not been paid within thirty (30) days from the invoice date shall automatically be subject to a late payment interest equal to 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by applicable law, which interest shall be compounded daily as of the due date until receipt of full payment by GuardSquare. In addition, the Client shall pay all costs incurred by GuardSquare as a result of the (extra)judicial enforcement of the Client's payment obligations hereunder. If the Client fails to pay any outstanding amounts within sixty (60) days from receipt of a written payment default notice, GuardSquare may terminate this Agreement, or alternatively, at its sole discretion, suspend GuardSquare's obligations and/or the Client's user rights granted hereunder by written notice to the Client until receipt of payment of such outstanding amounts.<br />

7.2 All Fees payable to GuardSquare under this Agreement shall be paid without the right to set off or counterclaim and free and clear of all deductions or withholdings whatsoever unless the same are required by law, in which case the Client undertakes to pay GuardSquare such additional amounts as are necessary in order that the net amounts received by GuardSquare after all deductions and withholdings shall not be less than such payments would have been in the absence of such deductions or withholding.<br />

7.3 If the Client disputes any portion of an invoice, the Client shall notify GuardSquare within fifteen (15) days from the invoice date of the nature of any such dispute, the basis for the Client's dispute and the amount involved, together with any appropriate information supporting Client's position, failure of which shall result in the invoice being deemed accepted by the Client. The undisputed portion of the invoice shall be paid as set forth herein.<br />

7.4 Sums stated to be payable under this Agreement do not include any applicable value added tax or other taxes, which shall be additionally charged to the Client. The Client is responsible for payment of all federal, state or local import, usage, value added, withholding or other taxes or duties associated with the supply or use of the Licensed Products, the Support Services or which may be levied or based upon the Fees, the expenses or any part thereof, and the Client shall promptly reimburse GuardSquare for any such taxes or duties paid by GuardSquare.<br />

7.5 The Fees may be subject to an annual adaptation on January 1st of every year according to following formulae using the Agoria &ldquo;refertelonen landsgemiddelde&rdquo; index or if the Agoria index is no longer published, the index replacing it or failing such index by another index reflecting the increases of labor cost:<br />
(New Amount) = (Old Amount) X (0.35 + 0.65 x (New Index/Starting Index)).<br />
A negative index shall have no impact on the Fees. GuardSquare has no obligation to inform the Client in advance of this adaptation.<br />

7.6 The Client shall keep accurate business records of its use of the Licensed Products for as long as it is entitled to use the Licensed Products as per the terms of this Agreement. Such business records will need to include details of the relevant License Parameters. The Client shall retain those records for at least three years (3) after any termination of its right to use the relevant Licensed Products. GuardSquare and/or its agents may inspect and review such business records, the Client's premises and any other information relevant to verify the Client's compliance with this Agreement upon reasonable notice (except where such notice would defeat the purpose of the audit), during normal business hours during the term of the Client's user rights hereunder and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, provided that such inspection right may not be exercised more than twice during any calendar year period, except where GuardSquare has reasonable grounds to believe the Client is acting in breach of this Agreement. If such inspection shows that the Client has underpaid the amount of Fees due to GuardSquare, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to GuardSquare hereunder, the Client shall promptly pay the amount of any such underpayment to GuardSquare together with any applicable late payment interest (as per clause 7.1 hereof). The Client and GuardSquare shall each bear their own cost related to any such review and inspection, provided that in the event of an underpayment by the Client or any other contractual breach as determined by such review and inspection, all costs related to such review and inspection shall be borne by the Client, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to GuardSquare hereunder.<br />
