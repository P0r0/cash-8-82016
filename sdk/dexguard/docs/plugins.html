<h2>Encryption Plugins</h2>

DexGuard can encrypt sensitive resources in your application with polymorphic
code. With DexGuard's plugin framework, you can replace the standard
encryption and decryption algorithms with your own.
<p>
With custom encryption algorithms, you can raise the bar for attackers who try
to reverse engineer and modify your applications. The greater the variation in
the obfuscation of your applications, the harder it becomes for attackers and
reverse engineering tools to recognize patterns and decipher the encryption in
obfuscated code.
<p>
You can write your own encryption algorithms for DexGuard's plugin framework
in Java, without the need to know Java bytecode or Dalvik bytecode. There are
three simple steps:
<ol>
<li><a href="#implementation">Implement your own encryption plugin class</a>,
    based on the <a href="#dependencies">DexGuard API</a>.</li>
<li>Compile your plugin code and package it in a jar file.</li>
<li><a href="#configuration">Apply the plugin in your DexGuard build</a>.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies for custom encryption plugins</h3>

DexGuard comes with a Java-based API for the development of custom DexGuard
encryption algorithms. The DexGuard API classes require at least a Java 1.6
compiler.
<p>
You can find the DexGuard plugin API in the DexGuard distribution at
<pre>
lib/dexguard-api.jar
</pre>
<p>
It is self-contained, and does not depend on any libraries, other than the Java
Standard Library. Notably, it does not depend on <code>lib/dexguard.jar</code>.
<p>
You may use other libraries, such as cryptographic frameworks, in your
algorithm implementation. Note however that all classes used by your
decryption code will also end up in your obfuscated application, which might
run in another runtime environment (e.g., Android). If you should use
third-party libraries, also verify that their license allows redistribution
and modification of their code.


<h3 id="implementation">Implementing a custom encryption plugin</h3>

<p>
DexGuard's plugin API provides an abstract encryption class for each type of
resource that can be encrypted:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
    <th>Resource type</th>
    <th>Plugin API abstract class</th>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>String</td>
    <td><code>com.guardsquare.dexguard.encryption.string.StringEncryptionPlugin</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Native library</td>
    <td><code>com.guardsquare.dexguard.encryption.nativelibrary.NativeLibraryEncryptionPlugin</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Asset</td>
    <td><code>com.guardsquare.dexguard.encryption.asset.AssetEncryptionPlugin</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Android resource</td>
    <td><code>com.guardsquare.dexguard.encryption.resource.ResourceEncryptionPlugin</code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Each encryption class has an encryption and decryption method, taking either
an <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>, a byte array
or <code>String</code> as input. You can implement a cryptographic algorithm
for use with DexGuard by extending the appropriate encryption class and
implementing the corresponding encrypt/decrypt methods. The
<a target="_parent" href="plugins/index.html">DexGuard API Javadoc</a> provides a detailed
description of each of the encryption classes.
<p>
The following is a simple example of an asset encryption plugin, encrypting
assets by applying an exclusive or operation on all bytes, with a given
constant:
<pre>
public class SimpleConstantXorAssetEncryptionPlugin
extends      AssetEncryptionPlugin&lt;Void, Void&gt; {

    private static final byte OBFUSCATION_CONSTANT = 76;

    public OutputStream encryptAsset(OutputStream outputStream,
                                     Void         sharedEncryptionKey,
                                     Void         encryptionKey) throws IOException {
        return new XorOutputStream(outputStream, OBFUSCATION_CONSTANT);
    }

    public InputStream decryptAsset(InputStream inputStream,
                                    Void        sharedEncryptionKey,
                                    Void        encryptionKey) throws IOException {
        return new XorInputStream(inputStream, OBFUSCATION_CONSTANT);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
During the build process of your application, DexGuard will call
the <code>encrypt</code> method of your plugin to encrypt your application's
resources, before packing them into the output jar or apk.
The <code>decrypt</code> method of your plugin will be obfuscated and copied
into the application code, in the places where encrypted resources are loaded.
Therefore, the decryption code needs to be compatible with the target
environment of the application (e.g. Android).


<h3 id="configuration">Applying the custom encryption plugin to your
    application</h3>

Once your encryption implementation is finished, you can compile it and bundle
it in a jar file. You can then instruct DexGuard to use it, by adding the
following line to your DexGuard configuration:
<pre>
<a href="usage.html#pluginjars">-pluginjars</a> myCrypthographicPlugin.jar
</pre>
<p>
Then apply encryption to the various resource types as usual:
<pre>
<a href="usage.html#encryptstrings">-encryptstrings        [string_filter]</a>
<a href="usage.html#encryptnativelibraries">-encryptnativelibaries [file_filter]</a>
<a href="usage.html#encryptassetfiles">-encryptassetfiles     [file_filter]</a>
<a href="usage.html#encryptresourcefiles">-encryptresourcefiles  [file_filter]</a>
</pre>
<p>
DexGuard automatically picks up the plugin implementations in your plugin jar.
If it finds multiple implementations, it will randomly choose an algorithm for
each resource. The more implementations you can provide, the harder it will
generally become to reverse engineer obfuscated applications. For Android
resources (files in res/XXX), only one algorithm is supported per application.
<p>
If, for some resource type, DexGuard doesn't find a plugin implementation in
your jar, it will fall back to the default built-in algorithms.


<h3 id="parameters">Parameterizing the encryption</h3>

To increase the strength of your encryption, you can add variation to the
encryption, by parameterizing the algorithm with encryption keys. The
approach is slightly different depending on the resource to be encrypted.

<h4>Android Resources</h4>

For Android resources, the <code>encryptResource()</code> and
<code>decryptResource()</code> methods take resource-specific parameters
(resource ID, file name, file size) that can be used to parameterize the
algorithm. As a very simple example, you could use the resource ID as a
cryptographic key for our XOR-based encryption algorithm:

<pre>
    public byte[] encryptResource(byte[] bytes,
                                  int    resourceId,
                                  String fileName) {
        return XorUtil.xor(bytes, resourceId);
    }

    public byte[] decryptResource(byte[] encryptedBytes,
                                  int    resourceId,
                                  String fileName) {
        return XorUtil.xor(encryptedBytes, resourceId);
    }
</pre>

<h4>Assets and native libraries</h4>

Encryption keys are modeled using Java classes. The contents of an encryption
key class are specific to the algorithm it is used with; it can range from a
simple byte to a complex combination of primitives, arrays and other data.
Note that there are some restrictions on its contents; please refer to the
Javadoc of the encryption plugin classes for more details.
<p>
For assets and native libraries, there are two types of encryption
keys:
<ul>
<li>Shared encryption keys: a key that is shared by a group of resources.
    DexGuard automatically groups resources for key sharing,  based on
    internal heuristics.
</li>
<li>Resource-specific encryption keys: a key that is specific to one individual
    asset or native library.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Encryption key classes are linked to an encryption plugin via two generic type
parameters of the plugin class. Key instances are created and
initialized for a given (set of) resource(s) in the
<code>create*EncryptionKey</code> methods of the plugin.
These methods receive additional contextual information about the encrypted
resource(s), that can be used to derive a value for the encryption key.
<p>
In the following example, the encryption keys for a simple asset plugin
are defined by a simple byte; their value is derived from the group seed and
the asset file size:
<pre>
public class SimpleXorAssetEncryptionPlugin
implements   AssetEncryptionPlugin&lt;SharedEncryptionKey, EncryptionKey&gt; {

    public SharedEncryptionKey createAssetSharedEncryptionKey(long groupSeed,
                                                              Set  assetFileNames) {
        SharedEncryptionKey key = new SharedEncryptionKey();
        key.parameter = (byte) groupSeed;
        return key;
    }

    public EncryptionKey createAssetEncryptionKey(SharedEncryptionKey sharedEncryptionKey,
                                                  long                seed,
                                                  String              assetFileName,
                                                  long                approximateFileSize) {
        EncryptionKey key = new EncryptionKey();
        key.parameter = (byte) assetFileSize;
        return key;
    }

    public static class SharedEncryptionKey {
        public byte parameter;
    }

    public static class EncryptionKey {
        public byte parameter;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The encryption keys are passed as parameters to
the <code>encrypt*</code> and <code>decrypt*</code> methods, that can use them
to properly configure the encryption/decryption algorithm.
<p>
Although not required, you should preferably use both encryption keys to
initialize the cryptographic algorithm, for maximal security.
<p>
Continuing with the previous example, we can now combine both bytes of the
shared and individual asset encryption key in the encrypt and decrypt method,
and use the resulting value in a XOR operation:

<pre>
    public OutputStream encryptAsset(OutputStream        outputStream,
                                     SharedEncryptionKey sharedEncryptionKey,
                                     EncryptionKey       encryptionKey ) throws IOException {
        byte combinedXorValue =
            (byte)(sharedEncryptionKey.parameter ^ encryptionKey.parameter);

        return new XorOutputStream(outputStream, combinedXorValue);
    }

    public InputStream decryptAsset(InputStream         inputStream,
                                    SharedEncryptionKey sharedEncryptionKey,
                                    EncryptionKey       encryptionKey ) throws IOException {
        byte combinedXorValue =
            (byte) (sharedEncryptionKey.parameter ^ encryptionKey.parameter);

        return new XorInputStream(inputStream, combinedXorValue);
    }
</pre>
<p>
During the build process, DexGuard will generate the encryption keys
by calling the key creation methods for each resource, and pass these
keys to the <code>encrypt</code> method, together with the data to be
encrypted. At the same time, it will store all encryption keys in the
obfuscated application, and make sure the <code>decrypt</code> method, within
the application, gets called with the correct encryption keys for each
encrypted resource.

<h4>Strings</h4>

For Strings, there is no distinction between the individual encryption key and
the encrypted data. For a given String and shared encryption key, the
encryption algorithm generates a single output, the encrypted string data.
The contents of the encrypted data can be chosen freely, within the limits of
the framework &mdash; see <a name="#limitations">Limitations</a>.
<p>
The decryption method receives the shared encryption key, together with the
encrypted string data, and decrypts it back to the original String.
<p>
The following snippet shows a simple example of a string encryption that XORs
the character data of the String:
<pre>
public class SimpleStringEncryptionPlugin
extends      StringEncryptionPlugin&lt;Void, SimpleStringEncryptionPlugin.EncryptedString&gt; {

    private static final char OBFUSCATION_CONSTANT = 76;

    public EncryptedString encryptString(Void   sharedEncryptionKey,
                                         long   stringSeed,
                                         String string         ) {
        EncryptedString encryptedString = new EncryptedString();
        encryptedString.data = XorUtil.xor( string.toCharArray(), OBFUSCATION_CONSTANT);
        return encryptedString;
    }

    public String decryptString(Void            sharedEncryptionKey,
                                EncryptedString encryptedString) {
        return new String(XorUtil.xor(encryptedString.data, OBFUSCATION_CONSTANT));
    }

    public static class EncryptedString {
        char[] data;
    }
}
</pre>
