<h2>Verification</h2>

Once you have build your Android application with DexGuard, you should verify
that it still works and that it is suitably protected.

<h3>Functionality</h3>

First of all, you should make sure the application functions properly. If the
obfuscated application doesn't work, you may have to add some custom
configuration to <code>dexguard-project.txt</code>. The most common issues on
the Android platform:
<ul class="spacious">
<li><b>ClassNotFoundException</b>: the application tries to access a class by
    means of reflection, but DexGuard has removed or obfuscated it. You should
    explicitly preserve the class. For example:
<pre>
-keep class mypackage.MyClass
</pre></li>
<li><b>NoSuchMethodException</b>: the application tries to access a method by
    means of reflection (for a WebView, for instance), but DexGuard has
    removed or obfuscated it. You should explicitly preserve the method. For
    example:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers class mypackage.MyClass {
    void myMethod(java.lang.String);
}
</pre></li>
<li><b>Resources$NotFoundException</b>: the application tries to access a
    resource by its name (typically with <code>Resources#getIdentifier</code>)
    instead of its numeric identifier, but DexGuard has removed or obfuscated
    the resource or its name. You should explicitly preserve the resource. For
    example:
<pre>
-keepresources drawable/my_icon
</pre></li>
</ul>

You can look at the generated files <code>bin/proguard/seeds.txt</code> and
<code>bin/proguard/usage.txt</code> to check which classes and class members
DexGuard has explicitly kept (due to the configuration), or removed (because
they appeared unused).
<p>
Please consult the
extensive <a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> section if you
encounter other issues.

<h3>Static Protection: Obfuscation and Encryption</h3>

To check whether your application has been obfuscated properly, you can
inspect the build logs and apply the same tools that a hacker typically uses:
<ul>
<li><b>dexdump</b> (Android SDK): disassembles Dalvik bytecode to a readable
    text format.</li>
<li><b>aapt</b> (Android SDK): disassembles binary resource XML files to a
    readable text format.</li>
<li><b>baksmali</b> (open source): disassembles Dalvik bytecode to a readable
    source format.</li>
<li><b>smali</b> (open source): assembles this source format to Dalvik bytecode
    again.</li>
<li><b>apktool</b> (open source): disassembles and assembles entire
    applications: bytecode, Android manifest files, resource files, and
    assets.</li>
<li><b>dex2jar</b> (open source): converts Dalvik byte code to Java
    bytecode.</li>
<li><b>jad</b> (free): decompiles Java bytecode to Java source
    code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check the build log and mapping file</h4>

You can get some feedback on the results by looking at the build log in
verbose mode, with DexGuard option <code>-verbose</code> (and Gradle option
<code>--debug</code> to see the output). DexGuard then prints out some
statistics on the number of encrypted strings, classes, asset files, etc.
<p>
In the obfuscation mapping file
(<code>build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt</code>,
<code>bin/proguard/mapping.txt</code>, or <code>proguard/mapping.txt</code>),
you can see the obfuscated names of all classes, fields, and methods.
Class names and method names that are tied to the Android runtime can't be
obfuscated, and names that are preserved with <code>-keep</code> options
won't be obfuscated, but the other classes, fields, and methods should get
short and meaningless names.

<h4>Disassemble your processed bytecode</h4>

Although all Dalvik bytecode can be disassembled by definition, DexGuard makes
it much more difficult to interpret. Even if you don't understand the bytecode,
you can quickly check if your processed code contains sensitive strings, class
names, field names, or method names, by inspecting the output of
<code>dexdump</code>:
<pre>
dexdump -d -f -t dexdump.tmp MyApp-release.apk
</pre>
On Linux, you can pipe its output through <code>less</code>
or <code>grep</code> to quickly find strings.
<p>

<h4>View your processed Android manifest file and resource XML files</h4>

The Android build process converts resource XML files to more compact binary
versions, but you can still view them in a text form with <code>aapt</code>:
<pre>
aapt dump xmltree MyApp-release.apk AndroidManifest.xml
</pre>
Although the output format is readable, you may prefer the original XML format
that <code>apktool</code> can deliver, as discussed next.

<h4>Disassemble your processed application</h4>

You can inspect the entire processed application, including the Android
manifest file and the resource XML files in their original XML format, with
<code>apktool</code>:
<pre>
apktool d MyApp-release.apk
</pre>
However, <code>apktool</code> may not always be able to handle the hardened
code, crashing while generating its output. This can be considered a
useful feature, since the tool is also popular to clone and tamper with apps.

<h4>Decompile your processed bytecode</h4>

As a final step, you can check how well the code can be decompiled, with the
combination of <code>dex2jar</code> and <code>jad</code>:
<pre>
dex2jar MyApp-release.apk
jar -xf MyApp-release-dex2jar.jar
jad mypackage/MyClass.class .....
</pre>
At the very least, non-public identifiers should have obfuscated names that
cause all kinds of problems. Non-trivial optimized code is typically hard to
decompile and difficult to read. The decompiler also gets thoroughly confused
by encryption code. Even more so than with <code>apktool</code>, the
quality of the output depends a lot on the decompiler, so you may want to
try different decompilers: jad, JD-GUI, Fernflower, Halcyon, etc.

<h3>Dynamic Protection: Tamper Detection</h3>

Tamper detection is illustrated in the sample in
<code>samples/TamperDetection</code>. It is essentially a call to a method of
the DexGuard utility library to check whether the generated apk archive has
been modified in any way. Your application can then act accordingly.
<p>
To verify that the detection really works, you can tamper with the generated
apk archive yourself. The slightest modification will set off the
detector, so you can use tools like <code>jar</code>, <code>zip</code>,
<code>jarsigner</code>, or even <code>zipalign</code>. For instance:
<pre>
zipalign -f 4 MyApp-release.apk MyApp-tampered.apk
adb install -r MyApp-tampered.apk
</pre>
If you then run your application again, you should see your application's
tamper code being activated.
