# DexGuard's default settings are fine for this sample application,
# because all the serialized fields are nicely annotated in the source code.
#
# Otherwise, we'd need to explicitly preserve the serialized fields, with
# their original names:
#
#-keepclassmembers class com.example.Person,
#                        com.example.Name,
#                        com.example.Sex,
#                        com.example.Address {
#    <fields>;
#}
#
# We could use wildcards for the class names.
# "<fields>" already is a wildcard.

# We'll just display some more statistics about the processed code.

# Encrypt the classes that represent domain objects, so their fields and
# annotations are hidden.

                com.example.Name,
