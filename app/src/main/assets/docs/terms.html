    2.1 <strong><u>Registered Account:</u></strong><strong> </strong>In order to avail a Loan through CASHe, the Borrower is required to register himself with
    CASHe. The registration can be done only through a valid Facebook or LinkedIn identity. The CASHe mobile application runs only on an Android Phone and

    required to register with CASHe only once against which he will receive a Unique Customer Number. Once Borrower is registered with CASHe, he can apply and
    avail loans from CASHe from time to time without having to register again. If any of the Borrower's profile details changes, i.e. Employer, Salary,
    Address, Contact Details, etc., the Borrower must notify CASHe immediately.

    Borrower's social presence through Facebook and/or LinkedIn, his employment history, and evolution of his career. Essentially, it determines how likely the
    Borrower is likely to pay back the Loan and Amounts Due to the Lender. The SLQ uses the Borrower's internet presence as one of the reliable benchmark to
    ascertain the Borrower's creditworthiness. The SLQ could be determined by Lender itself or through any third party agencies or with help of CASHe
    technology support.
</p>
<p>
    2.6 The Borrower consents that he shall accept as final the SLQ arrived at by the Lender/third party agency commissioned by the Lender. The Lender or third
    party agency shall not be liable under any circumstances to share the computation or details or basis of arriving at the SLQ.
